(M^e)^d ,appro =, m (mod pq)

since lamda(pq) = lcm(p-1,q-1)
ed - 1 = h(p-1) = k(q-1)

=>

m (mod p) = m (mod q)

(m^e)^d ,appro =, m (mod pq)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)

 ed ≡ 1 (mod (p − 1)(q − 1)), since (p − 1)(q − 1) is divisible by λ(pq)
 However, in modern implementations of RSA, it is common to use a reduced private exponent d that only satisfies the weaker but sufficient condition ed ≡ 1 (mod λ(pq)).

 p and q both > 200 and is a prime
